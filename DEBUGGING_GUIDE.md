# Debugging Guide: App Loading Performance Issues

## Quick Fixes Applied

### 1. **Optimized Initialization Sequence**
- Made notification service initialization non-blocking
- Added timeout handling for auth and theme loading
- Added performance monitoring to track bottlenecks

### 2. **Reduced Splash Screen Delays**
- Reduced initial animation delay from 500ms to 200ms
- Reduced fade animation from 1500ms to 800ms
- Reduced scale animation from 1000ms to 600ms
- Reduced rotation animation from 2000ms to 1500ms

### 3. **Added Error Handling**
- Better error handling with retry functionality
- Timeout protection for network operations
- Graceful fallbacks for failed initializations

## How to Debug Further

### 1. **Check Console Logs**
Run the app and check the console for performance logs:
```
‚è±Ô∏è Started: App Initialization
‚è±Ô∏è Started: Firebase Initialization
‚úÖ Completed: Firebase Initialization in XXXms
‚è±Ô∏è Started: Hive Initialization
‚úÖ Completed: Hive Initialization in XXXms
üìà Performance Summary:
  Firebase Initialization: XXXms
  Hive Initialization: XXXms
  App Initialization: XXXms
```

### 2. **Common Issues to Check**

#### **Firebase Configuration**
- Ensure `firebase_options.dart` is properly configured
- Check if Firebase project is set up correctly
- Verify internet connectivity

#### **Network Issues**
- Check if Firebase services are accessible
- Look for timeout errors in console
- Verify Firestore rules allow read access

#### **Device Performance**
- Test on different devices
- Check available memory and storage
- Monitor CPU usage during startup

### 3. **Performance Thresholds**
- **Total initialization**: Should be < 3 seconds
- **Firebase initialization**: Should be < 2 seconds
- **Hive initialization**: Should be < 1 second
- **Auth check**: Should be < 2 seconds
- **Theme loading**: Should be < 500ms

### 4. **Additional Optimizations**

#### **If Firebase is Slow:**
```dart
// Add to main.dart before Firebase.initializeApp()
Firebase.apps.clear(); // Clear any existing instances
```

#### **If Hive is Slow:**
```dart
// In HiveService.initialize()
await Hive.initFlutter();
// Add timeout
await Future.wait([
  Hive.openBox(userBox),
  Hive.openBox(menuBox),
  // ... other boxes
]).timeout(Duration(seconds: 5));
```

#### **If Auth Check is Slow:**
```dart
// In AuthService.checkAuthState()
// Add caching for user data
final cachedUser = await _getCachedUser();
if (cachedUser != null) {
  return cachedUser;
}
```

### 5. **Testing Steps**

1. **Clean Build:**
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Profile Mode:**
   ```bash
   flutter run --profile
   ```

3. **Check Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub outdated
   flutter pub upgrade
   ```

### 6. **Emergency Fallback**
If the app still doesn't load, you can temporarily disable Firebase:

```dart
// In main.dart, comment out Firebase initialization
// await Firebase.initializeApp(...);
```

### 7. **Monitoring Tools**
- Use Flutter Inspector to check widget tree
- Use Performance Overlay: `flutter run --profile --enable-software-rendering`
- Check device logs: `flutter logs`

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Splash screen appears immediately** (within 200ms)
2. **Animations complete within 2 seconds**
3. **App transitions to login/main screen within 3-5 seconds**
4. **No blank screen for more than 1 second**

## If Issues Persist

1. Check the performance logs in console
2. Identify which operation is taking the longest
3. Apply specific optimizations for that operation
4. Consider implementing a loading state with progress indicators
5. Add offline mode support for better user experience
